# streamApp

# Models
  1. Long Short Term Memory.
  2. AutoReg
  3. Random Forest

# Goals.
The goal of using the three models is to get a prediction of all three models and use the prediction in which at leat two of models agree.
This is due to the fact that the models with the best accuracies are LSTM which is about 65%, and Random Forest having about 57% accuracy in predicting stocks, these are still quite low.
